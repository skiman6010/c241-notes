### Notes 08/30/16

A truth assignment - assigns true or false to all of the atomic proposition. 
(A = T, B = F, C = F) 

Atomic proposition - "indivisible"  p,q (not $p \wedge q$)

A truth assignment _satisfies_ a formula iff the formula is true under that truth assignment

Does (A = T, B = F) satisfy ($A \rightarrow \neg B) \vee (A \rightarrow B)$? Yes.

A formula is _satisfiable_ iff at least one truth assignment satisfies  it.

Is $p \leftrightarrow (\neg p \wedge q)$ satisfiable?  Yes (P = F, Q = F).
| P | Q  | $\neg P$  |  $p \leftrightarrow (\neg p \wedge q)$ |
| ------ |:-----:| ---:|---:|
| t | t | F | F |
| t | F | F | F |
| F | T | t | F |
| F | F | F | T |

Is $P \wedge \neg P$ satisfiable?  No.
| P | $\neg P$ | $P \wedge \neg P$ |
| ------ |:-----:| ---:|
| T | F | F |
|F | T | F|

A formula is a ***contradiction*** iff no truth assignment satisfies it. We could also say that the formula is ***unsatisfiable***.

A formula is a ***tautology*** iff every assignment satisfies it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tautology ex: $P \vee \neg P$.   Always going to end up with true. $P \rightarrow P$.

Is $(P \rightarrow Q) \vee (Q \rightarrow P)$ a tautology? Yes. (See table)

A ***contingency*** is a formula that has both satisfying and nonsatisfying assignments. EX: $P \leftrightarrow (\neg P \wedge Q)$, $P \leftrightarrow Q$, P

| claim | proof | disproof |
| ------------ |:--------:| ---------:|
| a fml is satisfiable | assignment | table|
|a fml is a tautology | table | assignment
| a fml is a contradiction | table | one true assignment
| a fml is a contingency | 2 assignments (1 true, 1 false) | table
|a set of fmls is consistent | assignment | table |


A set of formulas is ***consistent*** iff there is at least one truth assignment that satisfies all the formulas in the set. 

{$P \rightarrow Q, P \wedge \neg Q$} Not consistent.
