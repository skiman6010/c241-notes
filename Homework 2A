1. Give an example of each of the following.
	a.  ($p \rightarrow \neg q) \vee (p \rightarrow q)$
	b. $(p \vee q) \wedge [(\neg p) \wedge (\neg q)]$
	c. $p \rightarrow p$
	d. $p \leftrightarrow q$
	
2. Is it satisfiable or not?
3. A satisfiable formula is a formula that has at least one truth assignment that satisfies the formula. A contingency has both satisfying and unsatisfying qualities to it. Both are similar since a satisfiable formula can have a satisfying and unsatisfying assignment, but they are different because
