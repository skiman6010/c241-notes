### Notes 09/22/16

#### Subsets
 - The set A is a **subject** of the set B iff every member of A is also a member of B (if you have a member of A, then it is also a member of B) $A \subseteq B$
 - When A is a subset of B, But A does not equal B, we say that A is a **proper** and we write $A \subsetneq B$
 - When A is a subset of B, we say that B is a **superset** of A

"in" is an ambiguous word

"contains" is also ambiguous

Let A = {0, 1, 2, 3}
      B = {1, 2,3 }
      D = {n, | n $\in$ Z $\wedge$ 0 < n < 4}
      S = { $n^2 | n \in Z $}

True or False

 - $ A \subseteq B$
	   - False, $0 \in A$ and $0 \notin B$
 - $B \subseteq A$
	 - True, every member of B is also a member of A
 - $ B \in A$
	- False 
 - $B \subseteq D$
	 - True, {1, 2, 3} are all members of D. 
 - Is B a **proper** subset of D?
	 - No, because B = D.
 - D = A?
	 - No, $0 \notin D$, but $0 \in A$ 




#### Rules
To prove $P \subseteq Q$, you have to argue why every member of P is also a member of Q.
To prove $P \subsetneq Q$, you have to prove a counterexample of a meber of P that is not a member of Q. 
To prove $ P = Q$ (for sets P and Q), you have to show that every member of P is a member of Q ($ P \subseteq Q$) and vice versa ($ Q \subseteq P$).
To prove $P \neq Q$, give a member of one set that is not a member of the other set.

#### Theorem
The empty set is a subset of any set. (trivially)


#### Cardinality
Cardinality is one way to talk about the size of a set.

For a finite set C, the _cardinality_ is just the number of members of C. We write |C| for the cardinality of C.

|A| = 4
|B| = 3
|S| = infinite
