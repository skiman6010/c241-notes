Is $\neg \neg A $
   $ A \rightarrow (B \wedge C) / C \wedge A$ valid?


----------


$\neg \neg A, A \rightarrow (B \wedge C) \vdash C \wedge A$

> A, B, D ... $\vdash$ C - means that you can prove C using assumptions
> A, B, D...

Assume $\neg \neg A$ and $A \rightarrow (B \wedge C) $ are true. 
Since $\neg \neg A $ holds, so does A. (Double Negation)
Because we have $A$ and $A \rightarrow (B \wedge C$, we can get $B \wedge C$ (Application)
$B \wedge C $ leads to C. ($\wedge$-Elimination )
From A and C, we get $C \wedge A$.  ($\wedge$-Introduction) $\square$

#### Rules for writing "semi-formal" proofs

 1. Always write what you are proving before the proof itself *
 2. Always clearly indicate assumptions.
 3. Always indicate what rule you're using.
 4. Always indicate which formula(s) you are using.

#### Inference Rules

 - $p \wedge q \vdash p$ or $p \wedge q \vdash q$ --- $\wedge$-Elimination (simplification)
 - $p,q \vdash p \wedge q$ --- $\wedge$-Introduction (conjunction)
 - $\neg \neg p \vdash p$ --- Double Negation ($\neg$-Elimination
 - $p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q$ --- Application ($\rightarrow$ implication) (modus ponens)
	 - if you have  p implies q, then you'll need to wait until you can also prove p.
