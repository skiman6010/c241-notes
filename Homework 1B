### Homework 1B

1. Real World Examples
	a. "If you're getting started with a smart home setup or working on an upgrade, your wallet is probably feeling pretty light." This is a quote from androidpolice.com talking about how setting up a smart home is expensive and difficult.
	
	b. "Federal officials announced the action Thursday amid a series of measures that could threaten the survival of the chain, which has been the subject of state and federal investigations focusing on its recruiting and accounting practices." I found this proposition in an article by the LA Times about ITT Tech being banned from accepting new students. 

	c. "If done in a static method, the thread acquires the lock for the class object associated with the class." I found this proposition in an article on codurance talking about flaws in the Java synchronisers. I believe it is false because I can think of a specific way to do this flaw without it being a static method and without it acquiring the lock for the class object.
